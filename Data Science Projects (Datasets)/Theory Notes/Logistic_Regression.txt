Classification model

Regression: o/p is continous.

p
1-p

ratio of p/(1-p) is known as odds

log(p/(1-p)) --- logic function

log(p/(1-p))=x
p/(1-p) = e^x
p = e^x - e^x*p
(1+e^x)p = e^x
p(x) = e^x/(1+e^x)
p(x) = 1/(1+e^-x)


** logistic regression: is a type of probabilistic statistical classification model
** Used for predecting the outcome of a categorical dependent variable(i.e., a class label) based
	on one or more predictor variables(features)

p-value: probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis

acuracy score = (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)

**Actual churn customers are 595 + 692 = 1287
**ideally the model should predict all of them as churn (ie, corresponding to the business problem above)

**but out of these 1287 the current model only predicts 692 as churn

**thus only 692 out of 1287 or only about 53% of churn customers will be predicted by the model as churn .T

**the company wont be able to roll out offers to the rest 47% churn customers and they could switch to a competitor

**So

true positive
