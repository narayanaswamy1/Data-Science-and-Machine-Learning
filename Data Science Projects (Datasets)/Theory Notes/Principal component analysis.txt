* principle component analysis (PCA) is a technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset.

* its often used to make data easy to explore and visualize.

* PCA reduces dimentionally by finding a new set of features called components, which are composites of the original features
    , but are uncorrelated with one another.
    
    
*** slide 2:
PCA is used for Dimentionally reduction (also done by RFE)
* the first few PCs explains most of the variance
* the PCs are the vectors made by the algorithm(they are orthogonal/independent to each other)
